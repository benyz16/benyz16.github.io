                The musicians that leave the greatest impact on the world tend to be those that reveal so much of themselves in their playing. The recordings and performances of the late pianist Geri Allen evoke a spiritual longing tempered with a lightness and joy at being able to shrug off ingrown stereotypes of female jazz artists all in the course of one dazzling solo. Rush’s Neil Peart, on the other hand, brought a clinical, almost mathematical mind, and a desire to achieve perfection, to his drumming.
              </p>
              <p>
                When it comes to Eric Clapton, the celebrated guitarist with a 50-year career under his belt, his best performances are an outpouring of a bone-deep ache, born from personal traumas that were either self-inflicted or forced upon his slender frame over the years. Or, as with the artists mentioned above, they are expressions of pure ecstasy at the simple act of creating music, either on his own or bouncing riffs and solos off of his many collaborators.
              </p>
              <p>
                Both strains are what drew him to the blues as a youngster. As he wrote in his autobiography, Clapton, “It was as if I were being reintroduced to something that I already knew, maybe from another, earlier life… [It] went straight to my nervous system, making me feel ten feet tall.” He recognized the anguish in the words that his favorite artists like Jimmy Reed, Blind Blake, and Robert Johnson but set out, initially, to simply try to copy their playing style as best he could.
              </p>
              <p>
                That he was able to draw both the pain and the poetry of the blues out of his middle-class upbringing in the village of Ripley in the southeast of England says so much about his innate abilities as a musician and about the anguish he felt at being rejected by his mother, a woman that Clapton was initially told was his older sister. He poured his angst into his guitar studies and quickly became a virtuoso. It’s little wonder that, soon after he joined the Yardbirds, many fans who came to see the group would stick to his side of the stage. Through his playing, “The Clapton Clique,” as drummer Jim McCarty called them, found a conduit to the generations of oppression that fueled the work of his favorite blues and R&B pioneers — and that they and the guitarist could appreciate but never truly grasp.
              </p>
              <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p class="mb-0">Every time you pick up your guitar to play, play as if it's the last time.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                Clapton instead used the blues as a springboard. “One man with a guitar vs. the world, with no other option than to sing his pain” is how he puts it in the recent documentary Eric Clapton: A Life In 12 Bars. What better way to describe the classics within his still-growing discography. The pain is present within the material he wrote for the Derek & the Dominos album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs, tunes that served to express his tormented love for Pattie Boyd (then the wife of George Harrison), and “Presence of the Lord,” a smoldering psych-blues he composed for Blind Faith. It’s threaded through the albums he recorded in the ’70s when he was in the throes of an addiction to drugs and alcohol. And it’s most audible in “Tears In Heaven,” the powerful ballad inspired by the tragic death of his son, Conor.
